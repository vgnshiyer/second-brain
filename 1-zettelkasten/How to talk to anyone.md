## ðŸ“” Notes

You only have 2 seconds to show that you are a somebody. Use below 9 techniques to look like a somebody.

- Give a huge smile after staring a few seconds to make it look more genuine.

- Maintain a sticky eye contact. Look away if you have to ever so reluctantly. 

- Keep looking at your "Target" (The person whom you want to influence). Even when someone else is talking

- Keep a good posture

- After meeting a new person, reward your new acquaintance with your total attention. Make then feel special.

- When meeting someone, imagine they are an old friend

- Do not fidget when a conversation really matters. Hands absolutely away from your face. (Hands on the face makes you look like you are fibbing/lieing)

- Keep an eye on the expressions of you conversation partner. (Are they interested or not?) Act accordingly.

- Before getting into the conversation, visualize yourself getting into it as a super somebody, with the *hang by teeth posture*, shaking hands, using *sticky eyes*. Visualize conversing comfortably, making the other person comfortable. Visualize others being attracted to you.

- **Snall talk**: What to say after saying Hello?
Small talk is not about words. It's about music. Before getting into small talk, think music. Match the mood of the person. Put people at ease and sound passionate. Words don't actually matter. So don't worry about what you say. Match the mood.

- Anything is fine with a small talk, as long as you are not complaining or come across as rude.

- Wear something unusual to catch people's attention. Great starters for conversation.

- Ask for a few facts from someone about the person you want to talk to. Facts you can use as icebreakers.

- Never give one-word or one sentence answers. Prepare some facts about the topics like (where are you from?, what do you work as?)

- When introducing someone to a friend, dont give a naked introduction. Instead, mention an interesting fact about the person you are introducing as bait for your friend.

- Try to understand what your conversation partner enjoys discussing. Look for unusual references, words. Ask about them and notice if they like to talk about it.

- When you talk and not listen, you don't learn. In a conversation, listen more and talk less. Use power of silence.

- Use the parroting technique (just repeat the last two words) to keep the conversation going. 

- For small talks, looking up latest trending news is a great idea for starting a conversation.

- Notice the words you speak normally. Replace the words with enhanced synonyms. One word a day.

- Kill the quick me too. When your partner talks about an interest that you share, don't be quick to reveal it. By doing that, you come across as too hungry for a conversation. Casually reveal it after sometime.

- Start a sentence with YOU. It puts the pride of the person in question. For example, asking for a leave from boss (Can I take a leave tomorrow? to Can YOU do without me tomorrow? --> puts their pride in question, I like your suit to You look great in this suit.)

- never make fun of someone

- Talk about recent accomplishments of the other person if you want to. Not something that happened in the distant past.

- Never the naked thank you. Follow it with a "for".

- Before getting into a group of discussions, learn about the hot issues in their field and push the right buttons at the right time. Learn enough about the topic, to sound like an insider.

- Copy the movements of your conversation partner. They subliminally feel more confortable with you.

- Monitor the words, nouns, verbs, adjectives the person is using and try to echo them. Hearing their words back from your mouth make them feel that you share their interests, values and experienced.

- Empathize with what the person is saying. *Listen*. Use phrases like "That's a lovely thing to say." , "I see what you mean."

- When you meet a stranger you would like to make less stranger. Search for a special moment, use a few words that reprieve a laugh or a smile.

- To compliment someone, do not compliment the person directly. Instead, compliment about the person to one of their close friends. This way you evade the risk of coming across as a flattery, boot-licking sycophant. A compliment is more exciting when someone *overhears* it.

- Use your hands while speaking. Putting your hands in your pocket or scratching your head shows lack of confidence. 

- Compliment people upon hearing a good news about them.

- Use the name of the person more. More on the phone than in person.

- When on phone, you overhear the person getting another call or someone in the background, say "I hear your other line. Do you want to take it? I can wait."

- While communicating, note their favourite restaurant, film, tv show, high school honour. Bring up a reference to them during a future conversation.

- Never laugh at someone's faux pas (fo pa) during a conversation.

- When asking for a favor, do not withhold your true intentions. You risk coming across as deceitful when they learn your true intentions.

- Before saying something, let people complete what they are saying. Once their tank is completely empty of their inner noise, only then they can start receiving new ideas.
