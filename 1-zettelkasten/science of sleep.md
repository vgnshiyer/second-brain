## ðŸ“” Notes

#### Lack of sleep causes:
1. inflammation
2. high risk of cancer
3. premature death

#### Stages of sleep

There are 4 stages of sleep.
3 non-rem stages and 1 rem stage.

Non-rem 1 (15 min) --> Non rem 2 (15-30 min) --> Non rem 3 (Deep sleep) --> Rem stage --> repeat.

It is important to complete this entire cycle at least 4 to 5 times for a good quality sleep.

If you break this cycle at any of these stages, you need to start over. That essentially means that the sleeping time was wasted.

#### Military sleeping technique

- Lie down straight on your back confortably.
- Imagine all you muscles being pulled down by gravity.
- Body getting heavy and relaxed.
- Closing your eyes, imagine you are in an open field (laying on grass, a happy memory)
