### Handling people

> If you want honey, don't kick over the beehive.

> Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof when your own doorstep is unclean.

When you get the urge to criticize someone, think about your own shortcomings. People often have justifications for their actions pointing that they had to do those things and they did not have a choice. Criticism is futile. It puts them in the defensive and often risks the entire relationship forever. People work for positive rewards and not to avoid negative scoldings. 

> Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I can learn of him.

Flattery is a pale shadow of heart-felt appreciation. Flattery comes from the teeth out while appreciation comes from the heart.

> Actions spring from desire. Therefore in order to get people to do what you want, you need to arouse an eager want in them.

Act and speak in other person's interest. Understand what they want and act accordingly.

### Making people like you

> We are interested in others when they are interested in us.

If you want to make real and close friends, you need to act unselfishly, put time and energy in being genuinely interested in people. Showing genuine interest in people also creates loyal customers for your business. 

Tips: Remember people's birthdays. Greet them with enthusiasm.

> A smile is the best first impression you can ever make. 

Force yourself to smile even if you don't feel like it. Eventually you will start feeling good. Smile is a messenger of good will. 

> A man without a smiling face should not open a shop.

> Encouragement is much more effective in teaching than punishment.

The most important sound in the Universe for a person is their own name. The name is the sweetest sound for the person in the world.

> Many people call a doctor when all they want is an audience. 

It is far more important to be a good listener than to be a good speaker. People crave an interested listener. "To be interesting, be interested." Try to look for things that concern the person or interest the person, simply by listening. These give great topics for you to converse about. Ask questions they will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about their accomplishments.

Make yourself agreeable to people you want to influence. If you always try to look at things from the perspective of the person you are talking to, you won't be able to stop them wanting to do business with you.

> Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.

If we constantly make people feel important, they will look forward to being in contact with us. Be able to help the other person without them being able to return the favor. Use phrases like, "Sorry to trouble you", "Would you mind..", "Would you be so kind as to..." Develop the attitude that whoever you meet is in some way or the other superior to you and that you can learn something from them.

### How to win people to your way of thinking

> Be wiser than other people. But don't tell them so

Best way to win an argument is to avoid it. How to avoid arguments:
- Welcome disagreement with intention to increase your knowledge.
- Control your temper. Avoid your first reaction to be defensive.
- Hear the person out before responding.
- Look for areas of agreement.
- Allow enough time to think things over.

Be wary of pointing out mistakes. You only make enimies in the process. Prove something to the person without them being aware that you are the one doing it.

> You cannot teach a man anything. You can only help him find it within him.

While discussing an argument, start with all the things you both agree upon.

People would much rather feel like doing something on their own accord. No one likes to be told to do something.

Make people talk about their achievements and struggles. They will like you a lot more.

When you discover that a person is in the wrong, don't quickly condemn them. Try to see things from their perspective.

People crave for sympathy. Magic phrase: "I don't blame you one iota for feeling the way you do. In fact, if I were in your shoes, I would feel the same way."

### Principles of good leadership

If you want to point out a constructive criticism about a person, begin with a sincere praise first. This puts them in a better position to receive the criticism well. Look for things they do well before you talk about the things they could do better.

Bring attention to mistakes of people indirectly. Never use the word "but". Use the word "and" instead. Eg. You are doing really great and (but) if you work harder, you can do much better.

Starting with your own mistakes first before pointing out other person's mistakes makes them more likely to listen.

Couch your requests as suggestions. Eg. Don't say "Do this", "Don't do that". Say "Do you think this would work? Encourages cooepration instead of rebellion. People feel you are more credible. 

Let people do things by themselves. Encourages cooperation and a positive working environment. Ask questions rather than barking out orders.

Praise the good rather than criticize the bad. Be hearty in your praise. Next time you feel like criticizing someone, try praising them instead for their goods.

Encourage and make things seem easy to do, by letting the other person know that you have faith in their ability to do something. 

**How to make people do what you want?**
- Be sincere. Don't promise what you can't deliver.
- Look from their perspective.
- Understand what is in it for them.
- Align it with their wants.
- Couch your request as suggestions.
