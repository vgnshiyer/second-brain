## ðŸ“” Notes

### Know you audience
- determine the target addressible market.
- if you are unsure about the audience, cast a wide net.
- if your audience is technical, dont be too basic. They will take it as insult.
- if your audience is non-technical, dont use jargons.
- presentation should be localized --> adapt to your audience. (baseball reference in an audience from a region that watches cricket.) 
- what are they interested in?
- what do they know?

**10 things to consider:**
1. age?
2. vip in audience? --> you need to focus more on
3. where are most people from? --> helpful for personal stories or small talks
4. recent inspiring event? --> search google: inspiring event region
5. over 50% know you? --> personal examples might be relevant. Else. you need to give some background.
6. audience achievements

Before adding any line in your ppt, ask "SO WHAT?".

People might forget what you say. But they will remember how you made them feel.
