### Virtual presentation skills

1. Start with a good opener. --> have people immediately listen to you
    --> state your full name with the inflections down for the last syllable.
    --> Give ur credentials --> how what you do helps them (Whats in it for them)
    --> stay non-nervous throughout.
2. Whats the problem the audience is experiencing? --> my solution : This is the HOOK.
3. 3 things --> what you will give them, how, and why
    --> most compellying is the WHY. That is the hook!
4. summarize the takeaways.

#### 5 W's
* What are your worries? 
* What are your challenges? 
* What problems do they cause? 
* What is the ideal outcome?
* What would that do for you?

- Rehearse effectively. 90% of the time I should be concerned about the audience.. and 10% about the content.
- practice 6 times in real time. 2 times before.
- rehearse the way you are going to present.
- in the exact same spot you are going to give it.
- Its not about you when u give a presentation. its about them. They are facing a problem.

- Command your body.
- focus on your tone.
- your words are 18% of your communication and the tone is 82%.
- eliminate fillers. (so, alright, okay, um, you know, uh, well, and, now, right, like)
- REPLACE with a half second pause.
- eg. "Alright. let's start with the next topic." --> "<Pause> Let's start with the next topic." 
- deep resonate tone.
- best pace for a video -> 200 words per minute.
- sweet spots --> 180 words per minute
- Pause when you want to make an important point.
- Inflection should go up to show enthusiasm, down to show confidence.

- keep them captivated.
- Keep it under 30 minutes without relying on a script.
- refer the Hook in the beginning.
- repeat the HOOK 3 times.
- reference to stories that shows empathy to what their pain was.
- Make them feel safe --> make them laugh
(Bad idea to try making them laugh in the beginning)
- Use quotes --> should relate to the hook

- show the presentation was worthwhile
- summarize what they got. (whats in it for them)
- Summary: What they got --> Why that helped them solve their problem?
- WHY is the most important thing. It should be stated in the beginning during the start of the presentation. It should be stated at the end while ending the presentation.
- eg. WHY, WHAT -- WHAT WHY

#### Steps
1. Create your blueprint and introduction (What you are going to say)
2. add 3 stories, humor or quotes.
    - nerves show in the first 5 minutes.
3. practice 3 to 6 times in real time.
4. record to identify strengths & weaknesses.
5. tweak their voice, stance and fillers.
