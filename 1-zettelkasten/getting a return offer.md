## ðŸ“” Notes

### Getting involved
- Act with urgency. Internships are short, you need to act quick and justify a return offer.
- Do not hesitate to ask questions.
- Don't rabbit hole to understand the codebase. Just focus on completing as many tasks at hand as possible.
- *Aim to merge you first code by end of week 1*
	- This is rarely ever possible (I got my access on the third day of the week) 
	- I don't know what you have to do to justify that you can actually merge some code right in your first week.

### Manager relationship
- Aim to have 1:1 meeting with them, ideally at a weekly spell.
- Tell your manager that you highly value transparent feedbacks. Act on them quickly.
- Ask questions like "Based on/Relative to your expectations, how far along do you think I am?"

### Coding
- Keep your code changes focussed. Once change per request. 25-250LOC is a decent target.
- Make sure to add test plans to the code changes. Descriptions with screenshots are a bonus.
- Keep tabs on code review comments. Respond to them quickly (within 30 minutes).

### Team work
- Broadcast updates regularly. Include clear description of the problem, progress so far, and a request for feedback.
- Add links to work in the updates.
- Schedule 1:1 with key people in the project.
