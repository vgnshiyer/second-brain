Crucial conversations are high stakes conversations which are avoided or handled poorly.

High performers hold crucial conversations, often express controversial opinions when others want to but cannot.

Most important thing for a crucial conversations is that all facts are laid out in to open. Good communicators ensure free flow of information before getting into a crucial conversation. Bad communicators beat around the bush, hesitating to say what they want. Key is to add as much information to the "pool of shared meaning".

### Start with the heart:
Start with a goal for any communication (What do I really want?). And stick to it no matter what. (It might be tempting to get swayed by the influence of ego or the adrenaline)

What do I really want for myself, others and this relationship?

Also think about what you don't want to break out of useless either/or choices (silence or violence). Look for the third option.

### Spotting crucial conversations

Your body gives you signs (heart beating faster, getting franctic, speak fast, get angry) when the conversation has turned crucial. When u spot them, slow down, and remember the goal of the conversation. These are the moments where it is possible to get diverted by the ego.

### When safety is at risk

**Keeping an eye of safety**
Look for signs where other people are feeling unsafe (feel that they are not being heard). (Revert to silence --> not freely adding to the pool of meaning, revert to violence --> force their opinions in the pool / insult you)

**Forms of silence**: Masking (sarcasm, sugarcoating), avoiding, withdrawing
**Forms of violence**: attacking, ignoring others opinions by labeling them, forcing their opinions (controlling)

**The best don't play games (sugarcoating, sarcasm). They step out of the conversation, make it safe and step back in.**

What you want must align with the mutual purpose of the conversation. (What is best for both?)

Conversation only runs as long as there is mutual purpose. The moment the other person feels that their purpose is not respected, they feel unsafe and resolve to either forcing their opinions or withdrawing information from the pool.

#### How to restore safety ?

1. Apologize: Make it safe by apologizing for hurting feelings and return to dialogue.
2. Contrast: Re-establish what you want and what you dont want from the conversation, clarify any misunderstanding to restore safety. (Start with what you don't want.)
3. CRIB:
    a. 'C'ommit to seek mutual purpose
    b. 'R'ecognize the purpose behind their strategy: Try to understand the goal behind their actions. (eg. I want to stay home and relax --> I am tired and want some rest)
    c. 'I'nvent an alternative purpose
    d. 'B'rainstorm new strategies to achieve the new purpose
