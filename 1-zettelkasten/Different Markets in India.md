3 angles to look at as an e-commerce business
1. Cost
2. Convenience
3. Catalogue

Three markets in India

1. consumer class - 15k$
- Beauty, dining food and beverage -- major consumptions - 3x more than the rest
- iPhone is the most revenue bringing item
- focuses on catalogue and "convenience"
- Use youtube premium - don't want ads

2. aspirant  - 3k$ pm
- focuses on cost and catalogue
- focus on value for money

3. unmonetizable class - major - 1k
- only focussed on cost
- youtube free - don't mind ads

clever business like Blinkit focuses on India 1, because they can charge high premium for convenience. 
India 1 is not price sensitive, they are convenience sensitive.

Premium brands must sell on convenience sensitive platforms.
