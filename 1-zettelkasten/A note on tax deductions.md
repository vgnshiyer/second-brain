There are two types of deductions. Standard and itemized deductions.

If itemized deductions > standard :
    Go for itemized (medical, charity, home loan)
        WHY? --> Goal: reduce taxable income --> less tax pay --> 
            Therefore, if itemized deductions high, reduce taxable income by a higher amount --> more cash in hand

Example:

Income: 100k
tax rates:
10% on income up to $11,000
12% on income over $11,000 and up to $44,725
22% on income over $44,725 and up to $95,375
24% on income over $95,375 and up to $182,100

1. Standard deduction:
(Single) $13850
First $11,000 at 10%: $1,100
Next $33,725 ($44,725 - $11,000) at 12%: $4,047
Next $41,425 ($86,150 - $44,725) at 22%: $9,113.50
Total Federal Tax: $1,100 + $4,047 + $9,113.50 = $14,260.50

Cash left after deductions = $85,739.5

"We take x% of the max amount if the income is greater than that amount.. Plus for the next line we deduct the previous max amount."

2. Itemized deduction:
$20,000
Taxable income = 100k - 20k = 80k 

Now the same steps of deduction will be applied on the reduced taxable income.. 

Cash left now = $87k

Additional witholdings --> amount you agree to deduct from paycheck if you anticipate more tax liability --> to avoid penalties.
