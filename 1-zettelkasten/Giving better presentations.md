## ðŸ“” Notes

### 4 levels of communication
1. cliches
2. facts
3. feelings
4. empathy

Most presentations are at cliches and facts. The best ones are at feelings and empathy.
### Tips for a better presentation

- passion is contagious
- if you cannot explain what you do in 140 chars, go back to the drawing board.
- "big picture before detail"
- Big picture is easiest to process
- less information. The one thing you want people to remember.
- information - education - entertainment
- what's in it for me? what is the benefit for the listener? what is the problem?
- sell the benefit. how it will improve my life.
- you must answer what's in it for the audience before you event get into the slides.
- don't throw numbers without putting into context
(5gb storage vs 1000 songs in your pocket)
- Think visually
- slide must complement the message/story
- people are more likely to remember images than words
- the brain interprets every letter as a picture
- how to connect with people beyond the slide?
- never break eye-contact
- open posture
- you are selling dreams. not products.
- the two most important parts of a presentation are:
- the opening and the closing
- start with a joke or an anecdote
- something that gets them thinking

**My takeaways**
1. Start with the problem statement (The hook!)
2. Follow up with solution
3. Make sure the audience can relate to them
4. Try to make the technical facts relatable

**4-step formula**
1. The hook --> get their attention
2. Bridge the gap --> relate to your topic
3. Self-intro & preview
4. tell them what they will get
