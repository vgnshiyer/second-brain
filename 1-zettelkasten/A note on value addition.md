## ðŸ“” Notes

Commodities have the lowest margin. Eg. Milk < 5%

If you add value to the commodity, you can get a huge margin (premium).
eg. Rice < Idli Batter < Idli

Value addition also increases the shelf life of the commodities along with the margins. Commodity business die of price wars (John D Rockfeller killed other oil companies by reducing oil prices and killing their margins -> creating a monopoly). Add value to escape the price wars.
#### Concious capitalism
Helping the partners in producing maximum value and eventually increase profit margin should be the goal. Not extracting maximum value from the partner.

Invest heavily in branding.

Outsourcing provides cost saving but takes your control off of efficiency and quality.
