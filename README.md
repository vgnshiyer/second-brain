## Welcome to my Second Brain

A repository where I dump all my random thoughts, ideas, learnings and doubts. It's like a digital diary on my [command line](https://github.com/vgnshiyer/.dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file#3-bonus), but less embarrassing (hopefully).

### Why does this exist?

Because my brain can't remember things and sticky notes have tendency to disappear. Also, it makes me look like I'm doing something productive.

### What do I note?

Mainly tech, ideas, brainstorms and anything important.

**My workflow looks something like this:**

1. Anytime I feel like something is worth noting down, I run a command called [zet](https://github.com/vgnshiyer/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/fish/functions/zet.fish) to open a quick note.
2. This unnamed/unprocessed note goes to my [inbox](https://github.com/vgnshiyer/second-brain/tree/main/0-inbox) directory.
3. After [processing](https://github.com/vgnshiyer/second-brain/tree/main/0-inbox#unprocessed-notes-go-here), I drag them into my [zettelkasten](https://github.com/vgnshiyer/second-brain/tree/main/1-zettelkasten) directory.

Some other commands I use are:

1. `sb` --> opens the "second-brain" dir in vim. <C-g> helps me do a live grep and quickly find notes by their content.
2. `tday` --> opens my daily note.
