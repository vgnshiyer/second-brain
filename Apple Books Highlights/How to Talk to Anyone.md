## Highlights
here’s a foolproof trick to get the fire blazing again. I call it Parroting after that beautiful tropical bird that captures everyone’s heart simply by repeating other people’s words

---
If you eavesdrop on Big Winners talking with each other, you’ll notice a lot more you than I in their conversation.

---
Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. ‘Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your … what IS that?

I told Dan about how pleased Diane was to meet him yet how little she learned about his life. Dan simply replied, ‘Well, when I meet someone, I learn so much more if I ask about their life. I always try to turn the spotlight on the other person.’ Truly confident people often do this. They know they grow more by listening than talking. Obviously, they also captivate the talker.

---
When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s the time, as the old song says, to ‘ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive.’

---
Midas touch

---
Just make them a little less sticky when discussing personal matters with other men, lest your listener feel threatened or misinterpret your intentions

---
When talking with anyone, keep your ears open and, like a good detective, listen for clues. Be on the lookout for any unusual references: any anomaly, deviation, digression, or invocation of another place, time, person. Ask about it because it’s the clue to what your Conversation Partner would really enjoy discussing

---
faux pas

---
Suppose, for example, instead of responding to Nancy’s comment about the rain with ‘It’s good for the plants,’ Mrs Otis had said, ‘Because of the rain, my dog couldn’t go out.’ Nancy could then ask about her dog. Or suppose she grumbled, ‘It’s bad for my arthritis.’ Can you guess what old Mrs Otis wants to talk about now

Yet the human brain still immediately, instinctively, and unfailingly translates everything into terms of ‘How does that affect ME?’

In fact, now I’m involved in a case where a company actually discharged a woman for taking extra maternity leave that was a medical necessity.’ A mother can relate to that.

My friend Roberto was out of work last year. He applied for two positions. One was for sales manager of an ice cream company. The other was head of strategic planning for a fast-food chain. He did extensive research and found the ice cream company had deep sales difficulties and the food chain had long-range international aspirations. Did he send the same resume to each? Absolutely not. His resume never deviated one iota from the truth of his background. However, for the ice cream company, he highlighted his experience turning a small company around by doubling its sales in three years. For the food chain, he underscored his experience working in Europe and his knowledge of foreign markets.

Matching customers’ moods is crucial for salespeople

Adults camouflage their self-centredness under a mask of civilization and politeness.

‘How could my professional experience benefit this person’s life?’

To most people in our culture, profound eye contact signals trust, knowledge, an ‘I’m here for you’ attitude.


---
It’s only a slight exaggeration to say

---
No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with ‘Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear …’

---
Because when the average person tells a lie, he or she is emotionally aroused and bodily changes do take place. When that happens, they fidget. Experienced or trained liars, however, can fool the polygraph.


---
The last move to make before leaving for the party – even after you’ve given yourself final approval in the mirror – is to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material.

---
For many people, thinking is painful.
So Big Winners (when they wish to control, inspire, be loved by, sell to people, or get them to go to dinner) do the thinking for them. They translate everything into the other person’s terms by starting as many sentences as they can with that powerful little three-letter word, YOU. Thus, I call the technique Comm-YOU-nication.

---
I’m sure, to this day, Phil thinks of that trip as one of the best conversations we ever had. And all I did was parrot a few of his phrases.

---
Experts agree if you see the pictures, hear the sounds, and feel the movements of your body in your mind before you do the activity, the effect is powerful.

---
Worried about your first words? Fear not, since 80 percent of your listener’s impression has nothing to do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanour, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting.

Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident Big Cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger.
PS: Don’t wait too long to reveal your shared interest or it will seem like you’re being tricky.

Talking with someone with a German last name? Tell her about Columbus’s historic German Village with the brick streets and the wonderful 1850s-style little houses. It’s bound to inspire stories of the old country. Your Conversation Partner’s surname is Italian? Tell him Genoa, Italy, is Columbus’s sister city.
Talking with an American history buff? Tell him that Columbus was, indeed, named after Christopher Columbus and that a replica of the Santa Maria is anchored in the Scioto River. Talking with a student? Tell her about the five universities in Columbus.

The flooding smile
Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them.

---
Intrepid

---
a mistake in the millionth of a degree at the beginning, when the craft is still on the ground, means missing the moon by thousands of miles.

---
due to their own communications fumbles

---
Rehearse being the Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. See yourself walking around with Hang by Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. Hear yourself chatting comfortably with everyone. Feel the pleasure of knowing you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating toward you. Visualize yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens automatically.

---
slower to smile

---
Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your attractive lapel pin. Are you a golfer? Me, too. What courses have you played?

Top Communicators know ideas don’t come out of nowhere

When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When you’re talking, the spotlight is on you. When New Person is speaking, it’s shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you.

---
Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by nonpoliticians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers.

---
Any practitioner of the above professions should reflect on the benefit his or her job has to humankind. (Every job has some benefit or you wouldn’t get paid to do it.)

---
corrugated

---
There is no need, of course, to stay with mundane remarks. If you find your company displays cleverness or wit, you match that. The conversation then escalates naturally, compatibly. Don’t rush it or, like the Mensans, you seem like you’re showing off. The bottom line on your first words is to have the courage of your own triteness. Because, remember, people tune in to your tone more than your text.

---
keep your paws away from your face. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re fibbing.

Most people know if their Conversation Partners step back or look away, they’re not interested in what you’re saying. When they think you’re a pain in the neck they rub theirs. When they feel superior to you, they steeple their hands.

---
ilk

---
The first step in starting a conversation without strangling it is to match your listener’s mood, if only for a sentence or two. When it comes to small talk, think music, not words. Is your listener adagio or allegro? Match that pace. I call it making a Mood Match.

Theater?’ I parroted quizzically

incredulously

---
self-deprecatingly

---
Instead of having one answer to the omnipresent ‘What do you do?’ prepare a dozen or so variations, depending on who’s asking.

---
when delivering any bad news, they should share the sentiment of the receiver.

---
precariously

---
The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is ‘Encore! Encore! Let’s hear it again!’ The sweetest sound your Conversation Partner can hear from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people is ‘Tell them about the time you …’
Whenever you’re at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance

---
Anything!’ because almost anything you say really is OK – as long as it puts people at ease and sounds passionate.

---
Before opening your mouth, take a ‘voice sample’ of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a ‘psychic photograph’ of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.

---
virulent

---
nobody gets to the top alone.

---
brusque

---
Keep your Swivelling Spotlight aimed away from you, only lightly on your product, and most brightly on your buyer

---
Where do you get your conversational bait? Start by phoning the chamber of commerce or historical society of your town. Search the World Wide Web and click on your town, or open an old-fashioned encyclopedia – all rich sources for future stimulating conversations. Learn some history, geography, business statistics, or perhaps a few fun facts to tickle future friends’ funny bones

---
What a bounty it was to discover that he or she was wearing some weird, wild, or wonderful something you could comment on.


---
sycophant

---
Start every appropriate sentence with YOU. It immediately grabs your listener’s attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into ‘me’ terms.
When you sprinkle YOU as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice.

---
All it takes is an extra sentence or two about your city – some interesting fact, some witty observation – to hook the asker into the conversation

---
haggling

---
reverie

---
Well, I guess we talked mostly about me.

---
Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your Conversation Partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen.
Salespeople, why go on a wild goose chase for a customer’s real objections when it’s so easy to shake them out of the trees with Parroting?

---
People who are VIPs in their own right don’t slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one, don’t compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or insight it’s given you. If you do single out any one of the star’s accomplishments, make sure it’s a recent one, not a memory that’s getting yellow in her scrapbook

---
cantankerous

---
Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements.
Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the verbally elite.

---
Remember, deep inside everyone is a big baby rattling the crib, wailing out for recognition of how very special he or she is.


---
Sticky eyes
Pretend your eyes are glued to your Conversation Partner’s with sticky warm toffee. Don’t break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly, reluctantly, stretching the gooey toffee until the tiny string finally breaks.

---
Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through. Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the big top. When you Hang by Your Teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position.

---
swan song

---
Some people have excessive levels of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, a chemical cousin of adrenaline.

---
Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written resume off their printers for each position they’re applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to ‘What do you do?’ ask yourself, ‘What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?

---
The study went on to say a big, warm smile is an asset. But only when it comes a little slower, because then it has more credibility.

---
He highlights the specific benefits of what he has to offer to his prospect.

---
This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or woman you want to impact.

---
Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all,

---
Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what you’re saying. Then plan your moves accordingly.
If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You’ve got horse sense.

---
Be on guard. Don’t use any clichés when chatting with Big Winners. Don’t even touch one with a ten-foot pole. Never? Not even when hell freezes over? Not unless you want to sound dumb as a doorknob.

---
My body may have been in bed,’ he replied, ‘but I’ve been running.’

caressing

swellegant

A sure sign you’re a Somebody is the conspicuous absence of the question, ‘What do you do?’ (You determine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words that label you as either (1) a ruthless networker, (2) a social climber, (3) a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or (4) someone who’s never strolled along Easy Street.)

---
you can register your eyes as psychological lethal weapons when you master the following eye-contact techniques.

There’s also a quality that makes bosses hire and then promote, a characteristic that keeps clients coming back, and an asset that makes customers buy from them and not the competition

---
Never, ever, give just a one-sentence response to the question, ‘Where are you from?

wallop

And all because of this brilliant scholar’s admittedly common and unoriginal small talk.

---
 The secret to making people like you is showing how much you like them!

---
 Encore! makes a colleague feel like a happy dad, and it’s a great way to give dying conversation a heart transplant.

---
gaffes

---
If you flash everybody the same smile, like a Confederate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty Big Players find in each new face.
If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her.

---
For example, if you turn to the word smart, you’ll find dozens of synonyms. There are colourful, rich words like ingenious, resourceful, adroit, shrewd, and many more. Run down the list and say each out loud. Which ones fit your personality? Which ones seem right for you? Try each on like a suit of clothes to see which feel comfortable. Choose a few favourites and practise saying them aloud until they become a natural staple of your vocabulary. The next time you want to compliment someone on being smart, say, you’ll be purring

Here’s the technique I call Kill the Quick ‘Me, Too!’ Whenever people mention an activity or interest you share, let them enjoy discussing their passion. Then, when the time is right, casually mention you share their interest.

---
indelible

---
exasperated

---
Never, ever, make a joke at anyone else’s expense. You’ll wind up paying for it, dearly.

Hayakawa delivered his sentiments with sincerity and passion.

---
Like a good gumshoe, listen to your Conversation Partner’s every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that’s hot for the other person

---
A Whatzit is anything you wear or carry that is unusual – a unique pin, an interesting purse, a strange tie, an amusing hat. A Whatzit is any object that draws people’s attention and inspires them to approach you and ask, ‘Uh, what’s that?

---
Here’s my ‘anything, except liverwurst’ on small talk. Anything you say is fine as long as it is not complaining, rude, or unpleasant. If the first words out of your mouth are a complaint, BLAM, people label you a complainer. 

---
When asked the inevitable ‘And what do YOU do,’ you may think ‘I’m an economist,’ ‘an educator,’ ‘an engineer’ is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying ‘I’m a paleontologist,’ ‘psychoanalyst,’ or ‘pornographer.’
Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, they’ll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray

---
Don’t say ‘financial planner.’ Say ‘I help people plan their financial future.’

laconic

Big Players in life choose words to match their personalities and their points.

---
When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicissitudes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy mackerel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend!
The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes – and everything between.

---
You see, small talk is not about facts or words. It’s about music, about melody. Small talk is about putting people at ease. It’s about making comforting noises together like cats purring, children humming, or groups chanting. You must first match your listener’s mood.

---
No man would listen to you talk if he didn’t know it was his turn next.’

---
maintaining strong eye contact gives you the impression of being an intelligent and abstract thinker.

---
furtive

---
Don’t panic. Instead of signaling verbally or nonverbally that you ‘got it,’ simply repeat, or parrot, the last two or three words your companion said, in a sympathetic, questioning tone

---
Human resources professionals who interview applicants and police officers who interrogate suspected criminals are trained to detect lies. They know specifically what signals to look for.

---
Men talking to women and women talking to men or women: use the following technique, which I call Sticky Eyes, for the joy of the recipient – and for your own advantage.

---
conscientious

---
Whenever someone persists in questioning you on an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice. Hearing it again usually quiets them down

They know, when talking with a potential client, they should open their conversation with a benefit statement

You’ve been there. You’re introduced to someone at a party or business meeting. You shake hands, your eyes meet … and suddenly your entire body of knowledge dries up and thought processes come to a screeching halt. You fish for a topic to fill the awkward silence. Failing, your new contact slips away in the direction of the cheese tray.

---
prosaic

---
futilely fanning the embers of a dying conversation

---
nincompoop

---
When you act as though you like someone, you start to really like them.

---
posthumously

---
When introducing people, don’t throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like Big Clam, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then you’re free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity.

---
And when you consciously increase your eye contact, even during normal business or social interaction, people will feel they have captivated you

---
reprieve

---
How do you put people at ease? By convincing them they are OK and that the two of you are similar. When you do that, you break down walls of fear, suspicion, and mistrust.


---
Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, ‘And where are you from?’ never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one-word answer.
Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that Conversational Partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think you’re a great conversationalist.

Always make it thank you for something
